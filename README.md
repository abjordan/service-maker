# service-maker

Tool for generating slides for church services.

You will need:

* Font file (.ttf) for the font you want to use. If you have 
  it installed already, you can find it at C:\\Windows\\Fonts on 
  Windows, or at /Library/Fonts on MacOS, or you can use the raw font 
  file itself. For our church, we use Quattrocento Sans[1], a Google 
  font licensed under the Open Font License. You can download that
  font from the link below -- you'll need the Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic versions of the font.
* A logo file for your slides
* The text for the service (not included here due to copyright)
* If you're using something that has responsive readings, you'll 
  also need some glyphs for the markers. We use the LSBSymbol font[2] 
  to match our bulletins. Their license isn't clearly stated, but if
  you don't have an LSB license, you might want to try something else.
